            content="Yes. Make sure your data is available in spreadsheet format and upload it to our system. The spreadsheet upload creation method can handle 100,000 records with a single spreadsheet in one upload. You can queue five different uploads at a time, and those uploads can be for different departments, and apply to multiple groups. With file uploads, MoneyyApp works in the background so you don't need to stay on the upload page, and provides insightful tooltips and downloadable logs once uploads are complete."
